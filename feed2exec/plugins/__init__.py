def plugin_output(feed, item):
    """load and run the given plugin with the given arguments

    an "output plugin" is a simple Python module with an "Output"
    class defined which will process arguments and should output them
    somewhere. the plugin is called when a new item is found, unless
    cache is flushed or ignored.

    The following keywords are usually replaced in the arguments:

    * %(link)s
    * %(title)s
    * %(description)s
    * %(published)s
    * %(updated)s
    * %(guid)s

    The full list of such parameters is determined by the
    :module:feedparser module.

    .. caution:: None of those parameters are sanitized in any way
                 other than what feedparser does, so plugins writing
                 files, executing code or talking to the network
                 should be careful to sanitize the input
                 appropriately.

    :param dict feed: the feed metadata
    :param dict item: the updated item
    :return object: the loaded plugin

    if feed['args'] is None:
        args = []
    else:
        args = [x % item for x in shlex.split(feed['args'])]
    plugin = feed['plugin']
