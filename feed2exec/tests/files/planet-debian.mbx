In order to easily authenticate with IRC networks such as [OFTC][1] and
[Freenode][2], it is possible to use _client TLS certificates_ (also known =
as
_SSL certificates_). In fact, it turns out that it's very easy to setup both
on [irssi][3] and on [znc][4].

   [1]: <https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/>

   [2]: <https://freenode.net/kb/answer/certfp>

   [3]: <https://irssi.org/>

   [4]: <https://wiki.znc.in/>

# Generate your TLS certificate

On a machine with [good entropy][5], run the following command to create a
keypair that will last for 10 years:

   =20
       [5]: <http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/>

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout user.pem -x509 -days 3650 -=
out user.pem -subj "/CN=3D<your nick>"
   =20

Then extract your key fingerprint using this command:

   =20
   =20
    openssl x509 -sha1 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=3D/=
/;s/://g'
   =20

# Share your fingerprints with NickServ

On each IRC network, do this:

   =20
   =20
    /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Password1!
    /msg NickServ CERT ADD <your fingerprint>
   =20

in order to add your fingerprint to the access control list.

# Configure ZNC

To configure znc, start by putting the key in the right place:

   =20
   =20
    cp user.pem ~/.znc/users/<your nick>/networks/oftc/moddata/cert/
   =20

and then enable the built-in [cert plugin][6] for each network in
`~/.znc/configs/znc.conf`:

   =20
       [6]: <https://wiki.znc.in/Cert>

    <Network oftc>
        ...
                LoadModule =3D cert
        ...
    </Network>
        <Network freenode>
        ...
                LoadModule =3D cert
        ...
    </Network>
   =20

# Configure irssi

For irssi, do the same thing but put the cert in `~/.irssi/user.pem` and th=
en
change the OFTC entry in `~/.irssi/config` to look like this:

   =20
   =20
    {
      address =3D "irc.oftc.net";
      chatnet =3D "OFTC";
      port =3D "6697";
      use_tls =3D "yes";
      tls_cert =3D "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify =3D "yes";
      autoconnect =3D "yes";
    }
   =20

and the Freenode one to look like this:

   =20
   =20
    {
      address =3D "chat.freenode.net";
      chatnet =3D "Freenode";
      port =3D "7000";
      use_tls =3D "yes";
      tls_cert =3D "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify =3D "yes";
      autoconnect =3D "yes";
    }
   =20

That's it. That's all you need to replace password authentication with a mu=
ch
stronger alternative.

I was recently looking for a way to extract many attachments from a series =
of
emails. I first had a look at the [AttachmentExtractor][1] [thunderbird][2]
plugin, but it seems very old and not maintained anymore. So I've come up w=
ith
another very simple solution that also works with any other mail client.

Just copy all the mails you want to extract attachments from to a single
(temporary) mail folder, find out which file holds the mail folder and use
[ripmime][3] on that file (ripmime is packaged for [Debian][4]). For my cas=
e,
it looked like: =20

   =20
       [3]: <http://www.pldaniels.com/ripmime/>
   [4]: <http://debian.org>

    ~ ripmime -i .icedove/XXXXXXX.default/Mail/pop.xxxx/tmp -d target-direc=
tory
   =20

Simple solution, but it saved me quite some time. Hope it helps !
