Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
------------------------------------

Our Pledge
~~~~~~~~~~

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

-  Using welcoming and inclusive language
-  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-  Focusing on what is best for the community
-  Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
   attention or advances
-  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
   attacks
-  Public or private harassment
-  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
   electronic address, without explicit permission
-  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
   professional setting

Our Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
~~~~~

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting one of the persons listed below. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project maintainers is obligated to maintain confidentiality with
regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific
enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other members of the project's leadership.

Project maintainers are encouraged to follow the spirit of the `Django
Code of Conduct Enforcement Manual`_ when receiving reports.

.. _Django Code of Conduct Enforcement Manual: https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/

Contacts
~~~~~~~~

The following people have volunteered to be available to respond to Code
of Conduct reports. They have reviewed existing literature and agree to
follow the aforementioned process in good faith. They also accept
OpenPGP-encrypted email:

Attribution
~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant`_,
version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4.

 .. _Contributor Covenant: http://contributor-covenant.org

Changes
~~~~~~~

The Code of Conduct was modified to refer to *project maintainers*
instead of *project team* and small paragraph was added to refer to the
Django enforcement manual.

    Note: We have so far determined that writing an explicit enforcement
    policy is not necessary, considering the available literature
    already available online and the relatively small size of the
    community. This may change in the future if the community grows
    larger.

Patches
-------

Patches can be submitted through `merge requests`_ on the `GitLab
project`_.

Some guidelines for patches:

-  A patch should be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one
   identified and agreed problem.
-  A patch must compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on all
   target platforms.
-  A patch commit message must consist of a single short (less than 50
   characters) line stating a summary of the change, followed by a blank
   line and then a description of the problem being solved and its
   solution, or a reason for the change. Write more information, not
   less, in the commit log.
-  Patches should be reviewed by at least one maintainer before being
   merged.

Project maintainers should merge their own patches only when they have
been approved by other maintainers, unless there is no response within a
reasonable timeframe (roughly one week) or there is an urgent change to
be done (e.g. security or data loss issue).

As an exception to this rule, this specific document cannot be changed
without the consensus of all administrators of the project.

    Note: Those guidelines were inspired by the `Collective Code
    Construct Contract`_. The document was found to be a little too
    complex and hard to read and wasn't adopted in its entirety. See
    this `discussion`_
    for more information.

.. _Collective Code Construct Contract: https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/
.. _discussion: https://github.com/zeromq/rfc/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Aanarcat%20

Patch triage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also review existing pull requests, by cloning the contributor's
repository and testing it. If the tests do not pass (either locally or
in the online Continuous Integration (CI) system), if the patch is
incomplete or otherwise does not respect the above guidelines, submit a
review with "changes requested" with reasoning.

Documentation
-------------

We love documentation!

The documentation mostly in the README file and can be `edited
online`_ once you register.

Issues and bug reports
----------------------

We want you to report issuess you find in the software. It is a
recognized and important part of contributing to this project. All
issues will be read and replied to politely and
professionnally. Issues and bug reports should be filed on the `issue
tracker <issues>`_.

Issue triage
------------

Issue triage is a useful contribution as well. You can review the
`issues`_ in the GitHub project and, for each issue:

-  try to reproduce the issue, if it is not reproducible, label it with
   ``more-info`` and explain the steps taken to reproduce
-  if information is missing, label it with ``more-info`` and request
   specific information
-  if the feature request is not within the scope of the project or
   should be refused for other reasons, use the ``wontfix`` label and
   close the issue
-  mark feature requests with the ``enhancement`` label, bugs with
   ``bug``, duplicates with ``duplicate`` and so on...

Note that some of those operations are available only to project
maintainers, see below for the different statuses.

Membership
----------

There are three levels of membership in the project, Administrator (also
known as "Owner" in GitHub or GitLab), Maintainer (also known as
"Member" on GitHub or "Developer" on GitLab), or regular users (everyone
with or without an account). Anyone is welcome to contribute to the
project within the guidelines outlined in this document, regardless of
their status, and that includes regular users.

Maintainers can:

-  do everything regular users can
-  review, push and merge pull requests
-  edit and close issues

Administrators can:

-  do everything maintainers can
-  add new maintainers
-  promote maintainers to administrators

Regular users can be promoted to maintainers if they contribute to the
project, either by participating in issues, documentation or pull
requests.

Maintainers can be promoted to administrators when they have given
significant contributions for a sustained timeframe, by consensus of the
current administrators. This process should be open and decided as any
other issue.

Release process
---------------

 .. _Semantic Versioning: http://semver.org/

To make a release:

1. generate release notes with::

       gbp dch

   the file header will need to be moved back up to the beginning of
   the file. also make sure to add a summary and choose a proper
   version according to `Semantic Versioning`_

2. tag the release according to `Semantic Versioning`_ rules:

   ::

       git tag -s x.y.z

3. build and test the Python package:

   ::

       python setup.py bdist_wheel
       sudo pip install dist/*.whl
       feed2exec --version
       # check your emails and the logfile
       sudo pip uninstall feed2exec

4. build and test the debian package:

   ::

       git-buildpackage
       sudo dpkg -i ../feed2exec_*.deb
       feed2exec --version
       sudo dpkg --remove feed2exec

5. push changes:

   ::

       git push
       git push --tags
       twine upload dist/*
       dput ../feed2exec*.changes

6. edit the `tag on Gitlab`_, copy-paste the changelog entry and
   attach the signed binaries
