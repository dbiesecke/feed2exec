============================================
 feed2exec - execute code on new feed items
============================================

``feed2exec`` is a simple program that runs arbitrary commands on
snippets of RSS (or whatever `feedparser`_ can read).

Quick start

TBD.

Community guidelines
--------------------

The community guidelines are described in the :doc:`contribute`
document, which provides a nice template that I reuse in other
projects. It includes:

 * a code of conduct
 * how to send patches
 * how documentation works
 * how to report bugs
 * how to make a release

Why the name?
-------------

There are already `feed2tweet`_ and `feed2imap`_ out there so I
figured I would just reuse the prefix and extend *both* programs at
once.
